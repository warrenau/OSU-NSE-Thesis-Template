  abstract = {The Transient Reactor Test (TREAT) Facility provided thousands of transient irradiations and plays a crucial role in nuclear-heated safety research. The facility’s flexible design and multi-mission nature saw historic experiments for numerous reactor fuels and transient types but was never specifically adapted to address very-brief pulse transients akin to postulated Light Water Reactor (LWR) Reactivity Initiated Accidents (RIA). Since the behaviors of fuel under these conditions depends strongly on energy input duration and resulting cladding time/temperature response under pellet cladding mechanical interactions, this three-year project was conceived to investigate new pulse-narrowing capabilities. Kinetic models showed incremental improvements for minor facility enhancements including increased reactivity step insertions (to initiate the power pulse) and slightly-increased transient rod drive speed for pulse termination (“clipping”). Replacing peak fuel assemblies, repositioning non-transient control rods to hold down the “hot side” of the core, and balancing against required excess reactivity needs, the limiting fuel assembly power can be reduced by ∼20\%. This is a remarkable discovery of latent capability in TREAT, not only in enabling the subject capabilities for reduced pulse widths, but also significantly “uprating” the core’s transient energy capacity. Incremental improvements can likely enhance TREAT’s capability into BWR-relevant missions; briefer PWR pulse shapes can only be achieved with an advanced clipping system. Helium-3 (3He) was found to offer the greatest benefits for clipping design and overall performance. A unique concept showed great promise for enabling a 3He-based system with a reasonable cost; this design concept will likely become the focal point of future work.},

  abstract = {Transient testing of advanced nuclear fuels and other structural materials is pivotal for the research, development, and ultimate demonstration of nuclear energy. Transient testing capabilities exist on a global scale, but these various facilities have different operations and design characteristics. Furthermore, the irradiation experiment vehicles (IEV) used in these transient reactor facilities have varying designs depending on the materials and experiment requirements. The advantages and disadvantages of each facility are presented and discussed by comparing the design and capabilities across nuclear transient reactor facilities (TRF). Further, a discussion of a specific IEV from each TRF shows the operational similarities and differences across TRFs. This comparison shows how some TRF designs are best suited for specific research areas and how others are being re-designed with flexible capabilities in mind. This inventory and comparison of global nuclear transient testing capabilities provides insight into the history, current status and future of nuclear fuel and technology development.},

  abstract  = {Pulse generated in the Transient Reactor Test facility at Idaho National Laboratory can reach a minimum 
full width at half maximum of 100 ms. for a maximum power of 5500 MW with the current configuration. 
To reproduce conditions of a Reactivity Insertion Accident postulated for Light Water Reactor, the width 
of the pulse shall decrease down below 50 ms. to increase even more the maximum power. To reach this 
goal, it is intended to initiate higher power transient that could quickly be clipped to maintain the total 
energy deposition within the 2500 MJ limit of the reactor operation license. One of the pulse clipping 
options under consideration is the implementation of a fast-negative reactivity insertion system by injecting 
helium 3 in the core. Initial calculation shows that to ensure fast clipping of the pulse, the new system, in a 
form of a cartridge pre-inserted in the core, shall undergo a quick pressurization from near vacuum to 
minimum density of 2.2 kg/m3 in less than 5 ms. The HENRI (Helium 3 Negative Reactivity Insertion) 
facility has been designed and built at the Oregon State University to test the feasibility of such system, 
design a fast response pressurization system and test the repeatability of the process. To support this task, 
preliminary CFD calculations are performed. In this first stage of the project, only the gas dynamics part of 
the process is considered. Initial results show that the ultimate atomic density could physically be reached 
within the 5 ms. limit assuming an ultra-fast opening device.},

A series of physics tests were then performed emphasizing relevant transients for Light Water Reactor (LWR) fuels research. A series of fueled experiments were then conducted using LWR-type sub-length specimens in inert gas capsules with the primary objective to quantify the ratio of nuclear heat deposited in the core to that deposited in the specimens. This type of data can be difficult to measure but is highly important in the design and interpretation of transient tests. Five fueled capsules were irradiated and energy coupling factors (which express the ratio of nuclear heat deposited per mass in the test specimen to that deposited in the reactor core in units of J/gUO2MJTREAT) were observed ranging from 2.0 to 2.2 over a wide range of transient energies with good agreement between measurement methods.},

Using an experimental TREAT critical measurement and a transient for a small, simplified core, Rattlesnake and MAMMOTH simulations are performed building from simple infinite media to a full core model.  Cross section processing methods are evaluated, various homogenization approaches are assessed and the neutronic behavior of the core studied to determine key modeling aspects.  The simulation of the minimum critical core with the diffusion solver shows very good agreement with the reference Monte Carlo simulation and the experiment. The full core transient simulation with thermal feedback shows a significantly lower power peak compared to the documented experimental measurement, which is not unexpected in the early stages of model development. For this reason, a sensitivity analysis to the adiabatic model and the magnitude of the reactivity insertion are included.},
